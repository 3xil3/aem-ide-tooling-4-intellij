## ToDo List for this Test Project

This list is maintaining all the tests that should be added to the
project to improve the reliability and quality of the Plugin.

### 1. Test of the filter

We need tests to deal with filter's include and exclude, items on
the edge of the filter and with regex patterns inside includes.

* Includes of jcr:content, rep:policy, user service amends in install
* Excludes of OSGi bundles in install folder


### 2. Test of Permissions

* Handling of rep:policy files (merge vs. non-merge)

### 3. Test of Nested .content.xml files

* Handling of cq:editConfig
* Handling of dialog configuration
